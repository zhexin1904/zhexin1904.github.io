I am currently a last-year master's student in the Northeastern University Robotics program, and I am also a research assistant in the Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab [NEURAL](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/), under the direction of [Professor David M. Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/)

I am broadly interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robotic systems, with a particular focus on state estimation. Coming from an engineering background, I strive to translate theoretical advances into practical, deployable systems. Currently, my work centers on certifiable algorithms/global optimization, robust estimation, and distributed optimization for SLAM and computer vision problems.
