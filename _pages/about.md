I am currently a last-year master's student in the Northeastern University Robotics program, and I am also a full-time CO-OP research assistant in the Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Lab [NEURAL](https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu/), under the direction of [Professor David M. Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/)

I am broadly interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robotic systems, especially the mathematical foundations for state estimation problems. Currently, I am working on distributed second-order optimization and certifiable algorithms for the collaborative SLAM (CSLAM) problem.



**Collaboration is very welcome if youâ€™re interested !**
