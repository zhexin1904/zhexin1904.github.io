I am a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University, advised by Professor [David M. Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/). My research focuses on optimization for robotics.

I am broadly interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robotic systems, with a particular focus on state estimation. I also strive to translate theoretical advances into practical, deployable systems. Currently, my work centers on certifiable algorithms, robust estimation, and distributed optimization for SLAM and computer vision problems.
