I am currently PhD student in robotics at Northeastern University, advised by Professor [David M. Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/) and co-advised by Professor [Hanumant Singh](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/singh-hanumant/).

I am broadly interested in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of robotic systems, with a particular focus on state estimation. I also strive to translate theoretical advances into practical, deployable systems. Currently, my work centers on certifiable algorithms, robust estimation, and distributed optimization for SLAM and computer vision problems.

News
------
* **[Dec. 2025]** Finished my MS and starting a PhD at Northeastern University, and I’m lucky to continue being advised by Dave! Looking forward to connecting with folks working in optimization and SLAM/robotic perception. The thesis slides can be found here [coming soon].

* **[May. 2025]** Present our early result on certifiable factor graphs at ICRA 2025!
