My research focuses on advancing optimization techniques for robotic state estimation and navigation, particularly in SLAM back-ends. I am currently working on certifiable algorithms, robust certifiable methods, and distributed optimization. I am interested in both foundational algorithmic problems and the development of novel applications enabled by these techniques. My ongoing work focuses on:

## Certifiable Estimation
- Scalable factor graph–based certifiable estimation  
- Robust algorithms for certifiable estimation  

## Distributed Optimization
- Distributed certifiable algorithm

## Long-term Autonomy

- Large scale factor graph optimization
