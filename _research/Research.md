I’m trying to explore and address fundamental problems in robotic state estimation using tools from optimization, differential geometry, probability theory, and information theory. Coming from an engineering background, I also strive to translate these ideas into practical systems — such as high-performance C++ libraries and field robotics experiments.

The dream seems a little bit ambitious, and I’m still learning along the way:)

# Current research

My research focuses on advancing optimization techniques for robotic state estimation and navigation, particularly in SLAM back-ends. I am currently working on certifiable (globally optimal) algorithms, robust certifiable methods, and distributed optimization. I am interested in both foundational algorithmic problems and the development of novel applications enabled by these techniques.

## Certifiable Estimation

1, Factor graph-based certifiable estimation.

2, Robust certifiable estimation. 

3, Incremental certifiable estimation.

## Distributed Optimization

1, Distributed second-order bundle adjustment solver.

2, Distributed certifiable estimation.
