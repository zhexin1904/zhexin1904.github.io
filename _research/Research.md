My research focuses on advancing optimization techniques for robotic state estimation and navigation, particularly in SLAM back-ends. I am currently working on certifiable algorithms and distributed optimization. I am interested in both foundational algorithmic problems and the development of novel applications enabled by these techniques. My ongoing work focuses on:

## Certifiable Algorithm
- Scalable certifiable estimation  
- Robust algorithms for certifiable estimation  

## Distributed Algorithm
- Distributed geometric estimation

## Long-term Autonomy
